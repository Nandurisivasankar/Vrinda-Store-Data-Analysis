**DATA CLEANING:**

1. **Handling Null and Duplicate Values:** 
   - Identified and managed instances of missing data (null values) and duplicated entries.
   - Ensured data integrity and accuracy by addressing these issues.
   
2. **Standardizing Gender Column:**
   - Observed gender column containing variations such as 'M', 'Men', 'W', 'Women'.
   - Attempted a find-and-replace approach to replace 'M' with 'Men', but encountered an unintended     issue.
   - Problematic Result: 'm' in 'Women' was also replaced, leading to 'Womenen'.
   - Solution: Implemented a more refined strategy by:
     - Applying a filter to target 'M' specifically.
     - Replacing 'M' with 'Men' within this filtered subset.
     - Ensuring unaffected columns outside the filter.
   - Employed a similar approach for handling 'Women'.

**DATA PROCESSING:**

1. **Age Group Column Creation:**
   - Generated a new column to categorize data into age groups.
   - Facilitates more effective analysis based on age-related insights.

2. **Optimizing Worksheet Performance:**
   - Recognized potential sluggishness when using formula-based columns.
   - Mitigation: Instead of keeping age groups as formulas, stored them as values.
   - Enhanced the worksheet's speed and responsiveness.

3. **Extracting Month Information:**
   - Derived the month component from date columns.
   - Ensured availability of month data for future dashboard and analytical requirements.
